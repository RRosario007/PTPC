## About The Project
In this project, I've created multiple programs in order to practice my programming skills. The programs I've created so far are a calculator, a website, and a copy playlist program. All of my coding is not upto par with an efficien program and definitely has some mistakes, but by doing this I hope to become a pragmatic programmer. On top of that, I can look back at my code later and realize some of the mistakes I've made.

## Calculator

</p>
This is just a simple calculator program. I started coding the logic of the calculator first, then I worked on the user interface.
<br/>
Things I learned:

* The importance of planning before starting to program
* JSwing
* The importance of comments for when your revisit the program and for others to understand.

## Web Page
I created my own web page. It includes my work, how to contact me, and info about me. I got inspiration from La La Land for the color palette.
<br>
Things I learned:

* HTML & CSS
* The importance of creating a drawing of a website first in order to have a general idea of where things are going to go
* Picking a good color palette so that the website is something you want to look at

## Copy Playlist Program
I created a algorithm that uses web scraping in order to obtain the name and artist from a playlist on Apple Music and store it in a text file. 
Then I used selenium in order to find the songs on Youtube and add the song to a playlist on Youtube.

Things I learned:

* Beautiful Soup
* Selenium
